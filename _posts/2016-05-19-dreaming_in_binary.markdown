  Every since I was a kid, I loved applications. I would come home from school, jump on my Nintendo, and play Zelda. When I wasn't on my nintendo I would go play outside and make my own games up. You know, normal kid stuff, like the ground is lava where you would have to jump around stuff and not touch the ground or you get scorched to death (Which now that I think about it, that's a pretty morbid game for kids, haha). My childhood was pretty normal, but one thing has remained true since then, imagination.
  
  When i grew older, I began working on a computer a lot. I played around with HTML and CSS a little bit. I always though was really neat how I could create things on a browser. I would make game's that was multiple choice, it would tell you a little story, and you choose where to go, which you would basically choose a link that directed you to another page that either had more story, or ended the story in a very bad way (game over). I was always a gamer, and really wished I could just go in and see how they worked. When you press the controller key of A, how does that make you jump? I loved the idea that you could give logic to computer's to make them do what you wanted them to. To create something I envisioned seemed like something I had always wanted to do.
  
  Enterbrain Co. created an application called the "RPG Maker", to which I was very excited about. You could build your game very easily, and It was playable. Being the terrible artist and programmer at the time that it was released, I emmersed myself in creating games that people I knew could play and have fun with. My immagination never changed. In the program you could put together your own story, name your characters and enemies, as well as give logic to your game through a system builder in the app. As much fun as I was having with the app, one thing remained missing. In the app, you could write your own logic using ruby on rails and create games completely different then the standard game system provided. I knew at that point, that I wanted to code. I wanted to be able to give logic to an app, that when an user jumps into the app, they see and do exactly how i imagined it.
  
  I started my coding experience at Codecademy (www.codecademy.com). There I started out with HTML, CSS, javascript and a little Ruby. I absolutely loved being able create methods that gives logic to a computer. For instance, you want a method that add's two number's together?

```
def addNumbers(num1, num2)
 num1 + num2
end

addNumbers(1, 2)
=> 3
```

 Finally, I loved my coding experience so much that I wanted to make a career out of it. I found my calling, as the saying goes. A good friend of mine told me about Learn.co and Flatiron schools, to where she had been learning how to code and the career opportunities available after graduation. How could I say no to that?
